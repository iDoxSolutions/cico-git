    @Html.EmbassyName() City Online Check-In / Check-Out Application
</h2>
<p>
    This application aids you in the process of checking-in and checking-out at post.  It is intended to simplify the process for you by providing an easy to use interface for submitting the necessary information and documentation needed to get you and your family into country and settled in your new position.  It is also used when you depart Panama to help organize and track your departure activities.

    To start, begin completing your Checklist and your Personal Data.

When complete, items will turn green indicating that you have finished with this step.  Items will turn yellow if a step is partially complete – additional information or action is needed from you or the section responsible to fully complete the step.
